#Wilbur Project
A budget tracking web application for Denison University. Have quite a bit to do before deployment. Forked originally from Meteor-Budget project on Github.

To Do:
- [x] Layout Basic Structure of Site
- [ ] ~~Flesh out the UI~~ Perfect the UI
- [ ] Personalize UI and underlying structure for login despite using useraccounts:core
- [ ] Separate sections for student vs admin vs controller (to adjust the remaining balance...or something like that)
- [ ] Ensure item and transaction sections include everything needed
- [ ] Figure out the darn footer issue when working with JavaScript
- [ ] Rebuild the login interface and user system
